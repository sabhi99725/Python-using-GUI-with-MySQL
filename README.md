# Python-using-GUI-with-MySQL
This project involves building a basic passbook application that stores username and password information in a MySQL database and allow users to get the password for the given username.
Tkinter- Another top python library for GUI is Tkinter, which is an open-source python graphic user interface library. It is well known for its simplicity and comes pre-installed in python, meaning there is no work on your part, these features make it a great choice for beginners and intermediates, but it is not capable of carrying out larger-scale project.
Widgets-Widgets are the building blocks of graphical user interface programming, and they are used to view data or collect input from the user.
